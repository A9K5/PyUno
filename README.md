### Algorithm for the game UNO

##### Step 1

- Select the number of players. System creates the list for the players. Each user logins to get his number_id.
- Users get alloted 7 cards in random.
- and card deck and discard deck is initialized.
- Game begins

##### Step 2

- Assign a player as dealer and left of that starts up.
- Assign order in which the game moves on.
- User select a card, compare it with last card in the deck and the expected order if ok
        ? remove the card from the users hand pop it and add it to discard deck.
        : return false not possible.
- Player with zero card in his stack wins.


### Some basic conversions for cards.
- 11 = Skip
- 12 = Reverse
- 13 = Draw two
- 14 = Draw four
- 15 = Wild
